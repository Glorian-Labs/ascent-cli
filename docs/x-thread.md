# 🧵 X Thread Draft: Ascent CLI Announcement

**Tweet 1:**
Agents are the new consumers. But they don't have credit cards. 💳

They use **x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required)**.

Today, I'm launching **Ascent CLI**: The elite toolkit for building payment-enabled agentic commerce on @Aptos. 🚀

Why Ascent?

API Keys are for humans. x402 signatures are for machines. 🤖

Ascent makes it dead simple to:
✅ Scaffold x402-enabled APIs (Express/Next.js/Hono)
✅ Start a local dev facilitator
✅ Monitor real-time payment analytics

**Tweet 3:**
The killer feature: **Agent Identity & Reputation (AAIS)**. 🎭

It's not just about the money. It's about TRUST.

Ascent tracks every transaction to build an agent's reputation score. Now you can gate your services to ONLY high-trust autonomous agents.

**Tweet 4:**
UX matters for devs too. 🛠️

`ascent init` gets you from zero to a functioning paid API in <60 seconds.

Features:
- Stress test with multi-wallet support
- Move language helpers
- Dark-mode analytics dashboard
- One-command Vercel deploy

**Tweet 5:**
The machine economy is inevitable. On @Aptos, it's already here.

Check out the repo (pushed to Hebx/ascent-cli) and start forging the future of commerce. 🥠

Built for the Canteen x Aptos x402 Hackathon.
