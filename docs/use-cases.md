# 🎯 Ascent CLI - Strategic Use Cases

How developers are leveraging Ascent to dominate the agentic economy.

---

## 🤖 1. Pay-Per-Query AI Agents
**Problem:** Traditional SaaS subscriptions are inefficient for agents. An agent might need one image generated today and nothing for a month.
**Solution:** Build an API using the `Ascent Express Template`. Charge **0.05 USDC** per image.
- **Result:** No monthly fees for users; instant revenue for developers.

## 🛡️ 2. Reputation-Gated Infrastructure
**Problem:** Sybil attacks and bad actors can overwhelm decentralized APIs.
**Solution:** Use the `Ascent Reputation Engine`. Configure your middleware to only process requests from agents with a **Trust Score > 80**.
- **Result:** High-trust agents get premium performance; low-trust agents are throttled.

## 🤝 3. Automated Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Commerce
**Problem:** Autonomous agents need to hire other agents for sub-tasks (e.g., a "Researcher" hiring a "Translator").
**Solution:** The Researcher uses `ascent test` logic to sign a payment. The Translator verifies it via the `Ascent Facilitator`.
- **Result:** Zero human intervention. A pure machine economy.

## 📈 4. Real-Time Data Feeds (Oracles)
**Problem:** Oracles often require complex staking or massive upfront APT fees.
**Solution:** A weather or finance API using Ascent. Every time an agent pulls data, they pay **0.001 USDC**.
- **Result:** Micro-monetization of data at high frequency.
